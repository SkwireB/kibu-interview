# Kibu Technical Project

Welcome to the Kibu Technical Project portion of the interview! Congratulations for making it this far. This project should take between 1-2 hours to complete.

## Overview

This is a simple notes taking and member recording application for the Kibu Technical Interview.

## Libraries Used
NextJs - setup and server components
Axios - for interacting with the server using api calls
React Query - for managing server state by fetching and caching data


## Design

I designed my application to be customer accessible., 

## Run and Test
To run:

Install the json server

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Install any other dependencies

```
npm i
```

Start the json server

```
npm install -g json-server
```
This will host the json server on http://localhost:3000/.
Open a new terminal, and run the application in the dev environment

```
npm install dev
```

Then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001/, since 3000 is already hosting the json.
